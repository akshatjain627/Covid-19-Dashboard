*Tweets_Corona.ipynb* contain the program of twitter analysis. We got 45% of tweets positive, 33% of tweets negative and 22% of tweets were neutral.

*arima.ipynb* contain the time series model, arima and fbprophet, for the prediction of next week's cases.

*templates* folder contain all the html files used in front end development.

*static* folder contains all the other files i.e. css file and images for the aapplication.

*covid_analysis_prediction_flask.ipynb* is the main file which firstly do web scrapping is done. Then comes code for visualization and the code of prediction and twitter analysis contained under seperate function. Thus, whenever we switch between the tabs in web app it call the corresponding function.

We are hoping to extend the project by integrating the chatbot. 
Meanwhile, protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
